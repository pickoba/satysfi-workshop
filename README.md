### Language Server Support

The language server provides completion and explanation of inline/block commands.

This extension does not include the language server itself. You have to clone & build [monaqa/satysfi-language-server](https://github.com/monaqa/satysfi-language-server) on your own and configure as follows.

```json
{
  "satysfi-workshop.languageServer.enabled": true,
  "satysfi-workshop.languageServer.path": "/path/to/language server"
}
```
